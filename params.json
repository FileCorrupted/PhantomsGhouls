The game will seek to emulate the fun Ghosts and Goblins provided players. Features and mechanics are planned for the future that were not in Ghosts and Goblins. Currently the game is being made by one guy (I keep him locked up in my basement)\r\n\r\n### Project Status\r\n\r\n![Progress Bar](http://i.imgur.com/Oza4J5b.png)\r\n\r\nNothing, the foundation has been laid but there is no content yet. I will let the developer out of the basement tonight and maybe he will get some work done.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFileCorrupted(Noah Rayburn): [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FileCorruptedGM))\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns send them to me via twitter or filecorrupteddev@gmail.com\r\n","google":"UA-66245624-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
